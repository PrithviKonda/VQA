Tasks:

Set up a basic vector database (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB locally, or connect to a managed service).

Implement a basic text retriever (src/knowledge/retriever.py) using sentence transformers or similar to embed text and perform similarity search against the vector DB.

Populate the vector DB with sample knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia snippets).

Implement basic mRAG logic (src/knowledge/mrag.py) to:

Use the retriever to find relevant documents based on the input question.

Format retrieved context to be included in the prompt sent to the VLM.

Modify the inference engine (src/inference_engine/response_generator.py) or VLM inference (src/vlm/inference.py) to optionally accept and use retrieved context in the prompt.

Update the API endpoint (src/api/main.py) to optionally trigger RAG based on a flag or simple logic.

Add dependencies (requirements.txt: sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu/faiss-gpu or chromadb, etc.).

Write tests for the retriever and basic RAG integration (tests/knowledge/).

Phase 3: Advanced Knowledge, Reasoning & Inference (Week 7-9)

Goal: Implement the more sophisticated reasoning components and the hybrid response strategy.

Tasks:

Implement the placeholder structure for the Adaptive Planning Agent (src/knowledge/planner.py) based on OmniSearch concepts (question decomposition, tool selection, iterative refinement). This will likely remain a complex placeholder requiring significant future work.

Implement the placeholder structure for SeBe-VQA (src/knowledge/sebe_vqa.py), outlining the contrastive alignment model and MLLM re-selection steps.

Implement the example PubMed connector (src/knowledge/connectors/pubmed.py) and the base connector structure. Integrate connector usage into the planner/mRAG logic.

Implement the hybrid response generation logic (src/inference_engine/response_generator.py) orchestrating calls to VLM, knowledge components (retriever/planner), and the ranker.

Implement the placeholder for the answer ranker (src/inference_engine/ranker.py), outlining how it would interact with a judge model (e.g., GPT-4 API call).

Potentially add LLaVA-NeXT loading/inference capabilities (src/vlm/wrappers/llava.py, update src/vlm/loading.py, src/vlm/inference.py) for specific tasks like OCR, potentially chosen by the response_generator.

Refine API models (src/api/models.py) to handle more complex inputs/outputs if needed.

Include placeholder support for training the SeBe-VQA alignment model.

Implement an evaluation script (scripts/run_evaluation.py) to measure performance on benchmark datasets (e.g., VQA-v2, OK-VQA, domain-specific sets). Calculate relevant metrics (Accuracy, BLEU, ROUGE, etc.).

Integrate configuration (config.yaml) for training hyperparameters, dataset paths, evaluation settings.

Develop Dockerfile.worker (if needed for background tasks like complex planning or asynchronous processing).

Create docker-compose.yml for local development, linking the API, Redis, and potentially a local Triton server instance.

Set up the Triton model repository (deployment/triton_repo/) with the exported VLM (e.g., TorchScript/ONNX) and config.pbtxt.

Configure the API (src/api/main.py or via config) to send inference requests to the Triton server instead of running the model locally.

Configure Prometheus (deployment/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml) to scrape metrics from Triton (and potentially the FastAPI app if custom metrics are added).

Set up Grafana (deployment/monitoring/grafana/) with Prometheus as a data source and create basic dashboards for monitoring key metrics (latency, throughput, GPU usage, cache hit rate).

Key Files: deployment/*, docker-compose.yml, src/api/main.py.

Outcome: A containerized application ready for deployment, integrated with Triton for serving, and basic monitoring infrastructure.

Phase 6: Continuous Learning & AR Frontend (Week 14-15)

Implement feedback handling (src/continuous_learning/feedback.py) potentially via a new API endpoint to store user feedback.

Integrate active learning/feedback into the retraining pipeline (update scripts/run_training.py to use this data).

Set up the basic React project structure (ar_frontend/).

Implement a basic React component using React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber) and @react-three/xr to display a camera feed and simple 3D content (ar_frontend/src/App.js).

Implement communication between the AR frontend and the FastAPI backend (/vqa endpoint).

Tasks:

Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests (tests/) covering all critical modules (data pipeline, knowledge components, inference engine, API).

Perform end-to-end testing simulating user workflows (API calls, AR interaction).

Refine complex components (Adaptive Planner, SeBe-VQA, Ranker) based on testing and evaluation results.

Optimize performance (inference latency, throughput) based on monitoring data.

Complete and refine the README.md with detailed setup, usage, configuration, and deployment instructions.

Add docstrings to all public modules, classes, and functions.

Key Files: tests/*, README.md, all source code files (for docstrings).

Outcome: A well-tested, documented, and refined VQA system.

This plan provides a structured roadmap. Remember that development is often iterative, and you might revisit earlier phases as you build more complex components or encounter challenges. Good luck!
